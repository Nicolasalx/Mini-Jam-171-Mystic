## ðŸ“ˆ Jam-Specific Details

This game was developed in 72 hours as part of **Mini Jam 171** on Itch.io, which challenges developers to create games with a specific theme and limitation.

- **Theme:** *Mystic* - We've embraced the theme with a magical, otherworldly setting full of mystical creatures and powers.
- **Limitation:** *Constant Escalation* - The gameâ€™s difficulty, story tension, and enemies intensify with every level, embodying this limitation at the core of the gameplay.
